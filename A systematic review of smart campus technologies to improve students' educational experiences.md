## ABSTRACT 
<p align="justify">The concept of a smart campus (SC) is growing, enabling institutions to improve their services, decision-making processes, and overall campus sustainability. The current epidemic has sparked and strengthened the need for a paradigm shift, with virtual schooling and remote work emerging as attractive alternatives. As an educational institution, understanding campus users' learning experiences is crucial for reviewing and ensuring outstanding university courses. This study examines the concept of smart campuses, their applications, and the potential for better learning experiences. Using the Scopus database, the researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review. At the outset, 54 items were collected. Following a screening process of 38 publications using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 were eventually included in the review. This study discovered that smart campuses are a valuable concept that should be developed and implemented in institutions. Aside from that, the smart campus application raises other potential options, including the use of augmented and virtual reality to enhance learning, and the exploration of daily internet traffic, which enables traffic forecasting to optimize network service and personalized services. As a result, this study adds to the understanding of the potential applications of smart campuses, particularly in the learning process on community campuses.
