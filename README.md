# Big Data Analytics for Preschool
## Abstract
   This paper offers a detailed examination of Big Data Analytics (BDT) benefits, processes, and challenges in the preschool education sector. By simplifying institutions,  organizations, instructor techniques, statistical instruction,  and  evaluation  processes  BDT  plays  an  essential  role  in  maximizing  education  intelligence. Furthermore, BDT was used to examine,  classify,  and  forecast  learners'  needs,  as  well  as  vulnerability shortcomings and results, to advance their awareness outcomes and ensure that instructional programs are of high quality. The phases of jobs Big Data and how to process it were also described in this paper. While BDT makes a significant contribution to education, it faces several challenges in terms of security, privacy, ethics, and a shortage of qualified personnel, as well as data processing and storage. As a result, we will discuss the causes of some of the problems associated with applying big data analytics in the preschool market, as well as some recommendations for overcoming those challenges.
