# Article 1 : Big Data Analytics for Preschool
## ABSTRACT
   <p align="justify"> This paper offers a detailed examination of Big Data Analytics (BDT) benefits, processes, and challenges in the preschool education sector. By simplifying institutions,  organizations, instructor techniques, statistical instruction,  and  evaluation  processes  BDT  plays  an  essential  role  in  maximizing  education  intelligence. Furthermore, BDT was used to examine,  classify,  and  forecast  learners'  needs,  as  well  as  vulnerability shortcomings and results, to advance their awareness outcomes and ensure that instructional programs are of high quality. The phases of jobs Big Data and how to process it were also described in this paper. While BDT makes a significant contribution to education, it faces several challenges in terms of security, privacy, ethics, and a shortage of qualified personnel, as well as data processing and storage. As a result, we will discuss the causes of some of the problems associated with applying big data analytics in the preschool market, as well as some recommendations for overcoming those challenges. </p>
   
## INTRODUCTION 
A professor's pedagogical choices significantly impact student learning and graduation rates. High-quality lessons can accelerate learning, allow students to absorb more information, and help them make better study decisions. This learning efficiency benefits students by developing their skills and reduces demands on teachers.

Big Data Analytics is a crucial tool for improving education quality by enabling educators and students to make more informed decisions. It helps identify areas for enhancement in the learning process and offers new opportunities to advance schooling. The rapid development of data science and new technologies provides educators with tools to optimize their time and decision-making.

Furthermore, Big Data Analytics can help teachers develop soft skills like social and emotional intelligence. To effectively leverage big data, educators and students must understand how it can improve learning. This can be achieved through its ability to measure understanding, personalize the learning experience, and design more engaging courses.
