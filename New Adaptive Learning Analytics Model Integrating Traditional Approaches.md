# Article 2 : Big Data Analytics in Higher Education: A New Adaptive Learning Analytics Model Integrating Traditional Approaches
## ABSTRACT
   <p align="justify">Despite the explosion of interest in adaptive learning and learning analytics (LA) for higher edu-cation (HE), there has been relatively little research integrating educational approaches’ indi-cators to build an adaptive learning analytics model. Adaptive learning analytics (ALA) models have grown in favor of HE due to their claims of enhancing student learning outcomes, provid-ing personalized learning paths, and allowing students to interact with course material at their own  pace.  With  focus  on  using  data  to  personalize  the  learning  experience  and  the  environ-ment in which the experience of learning occurs, LA centers on enhancing education through meticulous data analysis, while big data (BD) in education addresses the overarching challenges and  opportunities  arising  from  extensive  and  varied  datasets.  These  concepts  are  intercon-nected, where LA and ALA specifically apply BD principles within the educational context. In this paper, we explain some BD concepts used in HE, define the essential perceptions related to LA, and analyze educational approaches to define the fundamental implications. Besides, we try to connect some LA model with educational approaches based on the big educational data collected in order to establish an efficient educational model. We include all steps cited before we  try  to  build  an  ALA  model  in  HE  that  resolves  the  limitations  of  the  oldest  models,  thus  improving the learner’s learning process by adding and treating additional indicators.
