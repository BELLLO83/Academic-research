# Article 2 : Big Data Analytics in Higher Education: A New Adaptive Learning Analytics Model Integrating Traditional Approaches
## ABSTRACT
   <p align="justify">Despite the explosion of interest in adaptive learning and learning analytics (LA) for higher edu-cation (HE), there has been relatively little research integrating educational approaches’ indi-cators to build an adaptive learning analytics model. Adaptive learning analytics (ALA) models have grown in favor of HE due to their claims of enhancing student learning outcomes, provid-ing personalized learning paths, and allowing students to interact with course material at their own  pace.  With  focus  on  using  data  to  personalize  the  learning  experience  and  the  environ-ment in which the experience of learning occurs, LA centers on enhancing education through meticulous data analysis, while big data (BD) in education addresses the overarching challenges and  opportunities  arising  from  extensive  and  varied  datasets.  These  concepts  are  intercon-nected, where LA and ALA specifically apply BD principles within the educational context. In this paper, we explain some BD concepts used in HE, define the essential perceptions related to LA, and analyze educational approaches to define the fundamental implications. Besides, we try to connect some LA model with educational approaches based on the big educational data collected in order to establish an efficient educational model. We include all steps cited before we  try  to  build  an  ALA  model  in  HE  that  resolves  the  limitations  of  the  oldest  models,  thus  improving the learner’s learning process by adding and treating additional indicators.

## INTRODUCTION
   Traditional higher education, with its uniform structure and pace, often falls short of meeting the diverse needs of today's students. This is especially true for those with professional or family commitments who need more flexible learning options, and for learners with varied abilities who require different levels of support.
### The Adaptive Learning Analytics (ALA) Model
To address these challenges, the Adaptive Learning Analytics (ALA) model offers a powerful solution. This model allows students to learn at their own pace while still meeting course deadlines, providing them with a more flexible and empowering educational experience. Instructors also benefit by using analytics to gain insights into student capabilities, which helps them continuously improve their teaching methods. The ALA model often uses a blended and online learning environment that includes flipped classrooms and digital assignments to create a personalized learning experience.
Our research uniquely focuses on integrating specific educational indicators into the ALA model's data analysis. This approach ensures that our findings are closely connected to established educational theories, which can help institutions make better-informed decisions.
### Research Context and Methodology
Our work is set against the backdrop of rising Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the growing demand for personalized education. We combine decision modeling with big data (BD) analytics to extract valuable insights from various datasets, which enhances the quality of institutional decision-making. This aligns with the broader field of Learning Analytics (LA), which uses methods like text analysis and process mining to understand student outcomes and provide personalized feedback. The ultimate goal of this research is to enhance student outcomes and satisfaction.
This paper is structured to first provide a background on big data and learning analytics in higher education. It then delves into analytical concepts, explains our specific methodology and findings, and presents our proposed ALA model for higher education. Finally, it concludes with a summary and a discussion of future research directions.
